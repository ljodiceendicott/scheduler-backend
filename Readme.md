# Scheduler application Backend

Ever need to stay organized/Not sure where you or your team are supposed to be meeting for at 3:30 today?

What about find one of your colleageus or Supervisors as you do not know their schedules?

This is a solution that should allow for these issues to be subsided.

This is the back-end portion of my scheduler project that will be used to communicate to the client side the data that is being requested.


This is built with Express.js and Node.js that will be hosted as the point of truth for the client applications to connect to.

This will be where the actions of retrieving and updating these locations will live and be returned to the client to make sure that they are always up to date on where they need to go.
